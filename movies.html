        It's not easy being the most popular and glamorous girl at Beverly Hills High. Especially when you're the envy of scheming Betties (female babes), persistent Barneys (unattractive guys), and teachers who go postal (freak out) when you turn your homework
        in late! Yet somehow 15-year-old Cher (Alicia Silverstone) keeps it all together, even finding time for extracurricular projects like finding a love match for her debate class teacher (Wallace Shawn), and giving a dowdy friend (Brittany Murphy)
        a fashion makeover. But Cher's tidy world starts to unravel with the sudden appearance of two total Baldwins (hunks): a sexy and stylish new classmate (Justin Walker), and Cher's square but cute "ex-stepbrother" (Paul Rudd). Now Cher is about
        to learn that when it comes to love, she's ...well, Clueless.</p>

        Shakespeare's classic battle of the sexes gets a witty teen makeover in this adaptation of "The Taming of the Shrew" set in modern-day high school. Bianca Stratford (Larisa Oleynik) is a tenth grader who has never gone on a date, as her parents have a
        rule that Bianca isn't allowed to go out with boys until her older sister gets a boyfriend. The problem is, while her older sister Kat (Julia Stiles) is attractive and intelligent, she's also a mean-spirited misanthrope who rubs nearly everyone
        the wrong way -- especially boys. Julia Stiles gives a star-making performance as Kat, a strong-willed but bratty girl manipulated into dating her equally impossible male counterpart, Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger), by a scheming boy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)
        who has eyes for Kat's younger sister. Full of cheeky humor and lively, likeable performances from its star-studded cast, this movie offers endless fun for all ages.</p>

      <p class="ma0 f6 f6-m f5-l avenir">Based on the 1993 memoir by Susanna Kaysen, this movie portrays the fascinating true story of a young woman's life-altering stay at a famous psychiatric hospital in the turbulent late 1960's. Questionably diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder,
        Susanna (Winona Ryder) rebels against the head nurse (Whoopi Goldberg) and top psychiatrist (Vanessa Redgrave), choosing instead to befriend the resident "loonies," a group of troubled women including the seductively charismatic sociopath Lisa
        (Angelina Jolie). But Susanna quickly learns if she wants her freedom, she'll have to face the person who terrifies her the most of all: herself.</p>
